I can honestly say that this week was the week somehow everything just seemed to have pieced together. 

I really enjoy using REACT and by using it, it has solidified a lot of what we were doing in previous weeks and confirming the way things function and somehow making the links to understanding a little easier to access. 

I was pretty excited to use React with it's nice user functionalities and how much more efficient it seems to get an idea running quickly. I feel way more in flow using React

I suprised myself that on Monday evening; having created and styled two pages and linked them together using click events but finding organising pages and components a little tricky. 

The roadblocks this week have been nothing compared to the last couple and I've even tried incorpoating some of lessons from the previous weeks to try and make a full stack app with all the features you'd usually see and the back end to keep that solid in my mind as that's what I've had the most issues with and have cause massive delays in delivering work.
